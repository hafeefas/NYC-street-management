# Pothole Patrol 🛣️

**Pothole Patrol** is an AI-powered web platform designed to verify and streamline the reporting of road damage across New York City.

Built as part of the **AI Tinkerers x Betaworks x Moondream Hackathon**, our project uses computer vision and public data to help NYC maintain its streets more efficiently.

## 🏆 About the Hackathon

This project was built during the **AI Tinkerers x Betaworks x Moondream Hackathon** (June 2025). Our goal was to demonstrate how lightweight AI can make a meaningful civic impact — in this case, by improving NYC’s pothole reporting process.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- We fetch NYC’s public 311 complaint data.
- For each reported pothole, we retrieve the corresponding **Google Street View** image.
- Using **Moondream’s lightweight vision model**, we automatically verify whether a pothole is present.
- This transforms raw citizen complaints into **high-confidence, actionable tickets** that can be used by city agencies.
- We also plan to allow users to upload their own photos to keep the pothole database up to date.
